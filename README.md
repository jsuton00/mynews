# MyNews - News Portal

## About the project

MyNews is a news portal app where users can get the top and latest news headlines from around the world. The app was built with React and Redux and integrated with NY Times API which provides relevant data for the app.

## Design

The app has a simple and modern responsive design which allows users to easily navigate, search and interact with the content. The app consists of three main components:

1. Search bar
2. News Category Navigation Menu
3. News Display

The Search bar is located on the top of the page. It has the app brand name and a simple search input field with a search button. In the search input field, a user can type in any keyword and search for any news article by its title, either by clicking the search button or hitting Enter.

On the middle left side of the screen, below the search bar, there is a News Category Navigation Menu. The menu has a home link button and links for specific available news category which includes general, business, health, science, sports and technology news.

By clicking on a nav link, the user is shown the news display page which is divided into two sections, a display of news cards and a latest news column located in the top right corner.

Each news card shows a news article with a headline photo, news category and subcategory, title and author. All of them are clickable which enables users to click on the card and bookmark it for later viewing. If a user bookmarks a news card, the save card will be stored inside of the app and shown on the home news page. The bookmarked news are labelled as featured so the user can differentiate between from other cards the user has not bookmarked yet. Also, the user suddenly stumbles upon on a news card the user has already bookmarked, that exact news card are assigned with red bookmark icon to indicate that the card is already bookmarked.
